Notice
======

This project is in an early development phase and should not be used in production environments; a stable API is still to be finalized.
Moreover, I develop this project in my spare time, so do not expect regular updates.

Usage
=====

The general idea of *funjional* is bringing typesafe functional features to Java.

### Ok, so whats that all about?

Since Java is a strictly object-oriented programming language lambda functions need to be classes and typed by generics.
Creating a new function is done by creating a new anonymous class that extends `_<R, O>` whereas `R` is the return type and `O` is the type of the function argument. As a class does not do any stuff per-se we also need to implement a function; `_` contains an abstract function `public abstract R _(O o);`taking an object of type `O` and returning and object of type `R` -- this function needs to be implemented by you.

### The collection library

The goal of *funjional* is not only to provide a concept for defining lambda expressions but also delivering built-in function for processing Java Collections and Arrays. Those functions are accessed statically from the `_` class as seen in the examples below.

### Multiple argument functions

I got that, but for now functions do only accept one argument -- how can I pass more than one argument?
Well, the simple answer is *you cannot*!
The long answer: *Tuple your arguments!*
*funjional* provides a concept for tuppling objects into `$` containers. The simplest container is `$1` which can be created by `$1 z = $.$(someObject)`. The object can be accessed by `z.a`. A `$1` is pretty useless, so the more interesting ones are `$2`, `$3` and so on. Creation is similar -- `$2 z2 = $.$(someObject, someOtherObject)`. Of course Zip containers are typesafe, so `$.$(1, "foo")` will yield a `$2<Integer,String>` with its members being accessible via `z2.a` and `z2.b`.

### Example

	// yields a fresh array [2,3,4,5]
	Integer[] ints = _.map(new _<Integer, Integer>() 
	{
		@Override
		public Integer _(Integer o) 
		{
			return o+1;
		}
	}, new Integer[]{1,2,3,4});


### The mighty fold

`fold` uses a special version of the `_` class with generic signature `_<R, $.$2<R, O>>` to provide an accumulator. For more convenient writing *funjional* delivers a subclass `__<R, O>` (note the double underscore) with an abstract method `public abstract R __(R acc, O o);` to be implemented by you.

	// yields 10
	int sum = _.foldRight(new __<Integer, Integer>()
	{
		@Override
		public Integer __(Integer acc, Integer o)
		{
			return acc+o;
		}
	}, 0, new Integer[]{1,2,3,4});

### The function library

*funjional* also includes a function library being accessible via static methods of the class `Fun`.

### Compliance mode

*funjional* uses non-standard Java notation of classnames (`_`, `$`) or using functions with the same name as a constructor (`_._()`, `$.$()`).
So there exists a compliance API with the following mapping:

 * `_` -- `Function`
 * `_._()` -- `Function.call()`
 * `__` -- `Accumulation`
 * `__.__()` -- `Accumulation.call()`
 * `$` -- `Tuple`
 * `$.$()` -- `Tuple.create()`
 * `$1` -- `Tuple1`
 * `$2` -- `Tuple2`
 * `$3` -- `Tuple3`
 * `$4` -- `Tuple4`

### Gimmicks

#### Variable arguments

Most Array functions can also be used with variable arguments. So `_.foldLeft(Fun.ADD(Integer.class), 0, new Integer[]{1,2,3});` is identical to the less verbose `_.foldLeft(Fun.ADD(Integer.class), 0, 1,2,3);`.

Help Developing
===============

With *funjional* being an open-source project, I encourage anyone to take part in development. Just fork this repository and add deliver back pull requests.
