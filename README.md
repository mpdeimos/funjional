Notice
======

This project is in an early development phase and should not be used in production environments; a stable API is still to be finalized.
Moreover, I develop this project in my spare time, so do not expect regular updates.

Usage
=====

The general idea of *funjional* is bringing typesafe functional features to Java.

### Features

* Functions with strict typing
* Tupling
* Currying
* Uses standard Java Objects (Lists, Arrays, Collections, Iterators)

### Ok, so whats that all about?

Since Java is a strictly object-oriented programming language lambda functions need to be classes and typed by generics.
Creating a new function is done by creating a new anonymous class that extends `$<O, R>` whereas `R` is the return type and `O` is the type of the function argument. As a class does not do any stuff per-se we also need to implement a function; `$` contains an abstract function `public abstract R $(O o);`taking an object of type `O` and returning and object of type `R` -- this function needs to be implemented by you.

### The collection library

The goal of *funjional* is not only to provide a concept for defining lambda expressions but also delivering built-in function for processing Java Collections and Arrays. Those functions are accessed statically from the `$` class as seen in the examples below.

### Multiple argument functions

I got that, but for now functions do only accept one argument -- how can I pass more than one argument?
Well, the simple answer is *you cannot*!
As in Haskell every function just takes one argument.

The long answer #1: *Tuple your arguments!*
*funjional* provides a concept for tupling objects into `_` containers. The simplest container is `_1` which can be created by `_1 z = _._(someObject)`. The object can be accessed by `z.a`. A `_1` is pretty useless, so the more interesting ones are `_2`, `_3` and so on. Creation is similar -- `_2 z2 = _._(someObject, someOtherObject)`. Of course Tuples are typesafe, so `_._(1, "foo")` will yield a `_2<Integer,String>` with its members being accessible via `z2.a` and `z2.b`.

The long answer #2: *Use higher order functions!*
*funjional* also supports nesting of functions that can be evaluated using currying or at once with special syntax. An example of an higher order function would be `$<A, $<B, C>> f = ...`. This means you have a function `f` that takes one argument of type `A`. Calling `f.$(a)` will produce another function `$<B, C>` taking an argument of type `b`. In order to call f with both arguments use `f.$(a).$(b)` which yields an object of type `C`.
Since this notation - both the function declaration and the evaluation - is quite verbose *funjional* offers a shorthand class `$2<A, B, R>` with an additional evaluation call `f.$(a, b)`.

### Example

	// yields a fresh array [2,3,4,5]
	Integer[] ints = $.map(new $<Integer, Integer>() 
	{
		@Override
		public Integer $(Integer o) 
		{
			return o+1;
		}
	}, new Integer[]{1,2,3,4});


### The mighty fold

`fold` uses a special version of the `$` class with generic signature `$<R, $<R, O>>` to provide an accumulator. For more convenient writing *funjional* delivers a subclass `$$<R, O>` with an abstract method `public abstract R $$(R acc, O o);` to be implemented by you.

	// yields 10
	int sum = $.foldRight(new $$<Integer, Integer>()
	{
		@Override
		public Integer $(Integer acc, Integer o)
		{
			return acc+o;
		}
	}, 0, new Integer[]{1,2,3,4});

### The function library

*funjional* also includes a function library being accessible via static methods of the class `Fun`.

### Compliance mode

*funjional* uses non-standard Java notation of classnames (`_`, `$`) or using functions with the same name as a constructor (`_._()`, `$.$()`).
So there exists a compliance API with the following mapping:

* `$` -- `Function`
* `$.$()` -- `Function.call()`
* `$$` -- `Accumulation`
* `$$.$$()` -- `Accumulation.call()`
* `_` -- `Tuple`
* `_._()` -- `Tuple.create()`
* `_1` -- `Tuple1`
* `_2` -- `Tuple2`
* `_3` -- `Tuple3`
* `_4` -- `Tuple4`

### Gimmicks

#### Variable arguments

Most Array functions can also be used with variable arguments. So `$.foldLeft(Fun.ADD(Integer.class), 0, new Integer[]{1,2,3});` is identical to the less verbose `$.foldLeft(Fun.ADD(Integer.class), 0, 1,2,3);`.

#### Function composition

Functions can be composed by the `o` operator like this: `Fun.MUL(2).o(Fun.ADD(1))` yielding a function that takes an Integer i and calculates `(i + 1) * 2`.

#### Currying
